            <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5em;">Key points</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Web accessibility is needed to <b>help those with disabilities</b></li>
                <li>There is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #8678f9;">Web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG)</a> which developers should follow</li>
                <li>Developers should have the <b>order of the code</b> be the same as the order in which the page is read.</li>
                <li>Code should be in a way that makes it <b>fit on a variety of screen sizes</b> (phone, laptop, etc)</li>
                <li>Use <code class="language-markup">tabindex = 0</code> in the CSS file to make important buttons keyboard accessible</li>
                <li>Use <b>as little CAPTCHA</b> as possible, as it can cause problems for people with disabilities</li>
                <li>Identify and use user's <b>native language</b> to make user experience more comfortable</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="list">
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2.5em;">Development Standards</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Include alternative text for images. For example, have an <code class="language-markup">alt="..."</code> on the images so they know what it is</li>
                    <li>Identify page language by including such code in your HTML: <code class="language-markup">&lt;html = lang="en"></code> </li>
                    <li>Have <b>each HTML element have its own class</b> so that you can edit it easier with CSS</li>
                    <li><b>Order the CSS and HTML</b> in the order it is displayed as the page is meant to be read</li>
                    <li>Allowing for users to understand your website is crucial. When you add in features that aren't as widely used,<br>they can be confusing for some people. <b>Providing insight to what these features do</b> can allow for an easier user<br>experience when interacting with your website</li>
                    <li>Ensure that <b>all interactive elements are keyboard accessible</b>.  Make it so that when you click a specific button,<br> an action happen which you can also do with your mouse.</li>
                    <li>For CAPTCHA: Provide more than 2 ways to solve it, and do not require CAPTCHAs for authorised users.</li>
                </ul>
