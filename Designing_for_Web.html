            <h2>What is Designing for Web Accessibility?</h2>
            <p>Designing for Web Accessibility includes the creation of an environment on the internet that is inclusive for everyone to use. In doing so the Web Page must provide clear contrast between foreground and background, the use of different colours and not just colours to convey information, different interactive elements are easily identifiable, clear navigation options, labels, feedback, headings and spacing, different designs, images and visually appealing content and controls for content that starts automatically.  
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="tip">
            <h2>Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background </h2>
            <p>The foreground and the background of text should have enough contrast as some people may not be able to see if there isn't sufficient contrast. This includes text on images, background gradient, button and other elements, However this does not apply for logos. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="tip2">
            <p>We have contrast, because this isn't very pleasing to the eyes, is it?</p>

        <section class="tip">
            <h2>The use of different colours and not just colours to convey information</h2>
            <p>Colour is helpful and visually appealing to showcase information however there must be a selection of different colours and it should not be the only way to present information. Colour should be used to convey specific elements of information rather than the information as a whole </p>
        </section>
        <section class="tip">
            <h2>Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify</h2>
            <p>By providing distinctive styles for interactive elements to stand out such as links and buttons to make it easy to find it. For example changing the appearance of links on mouse hover, keyboard focus, and many more, making sure that the styles and design for interactive elements are used consistently throughout the website.</p>

        <section class="tip">
            <h2>Clear navigation options</h2>
            <p>By enabling that navigation across pages acquires different styling, naming and positioning, the navigation options are clear and consistent. This is done by providing multiple methods of website navigation such as site site search or site map and helping users understand
            </p>

            <h2>Form elements have clear labels</h2>
            <p>
                - Avoid too much space between labels and fields
            </p>
                - Position text correctly and in order
            <p>
                - Labels are positioned above the writing fields except checkboxes where the text is next to it.
            </p>

        <section class="tip">
            <h2>Easily identifiable feedback</h2>
            <p>Feedback for interactions such as confirming form submissions or alerting the user of changes to the page and instructions must be easily identifiable as well as any important feedback that requires user action must be presented in a distinct style.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="tip">
            <h2>Spacing between heading</h2>
            <p>Use whitespace and proximity to make relationships between content more apparent. Style headings to group content, reduce clutter, and make it easier to scan and understand.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="tip">
            <h2>Provide controls for content that starts automatically
            </h2>
            <p>Provide visible controls to allow users to stop any animations or auto-playing sound. This applies to carousels, image sliders, background sound, and videos.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="tip">
            <h2>Multiple design for different viewports 
            </h2>
            <p>Information intended for the page must be displayed in different viewport sizes such as for phones or computers. The position and presentation of elements such as header can be changed to use up the space and the text must be set to ensure readability and legibility.</p>

            <h2>Images and alternate medias 
            </h2>
