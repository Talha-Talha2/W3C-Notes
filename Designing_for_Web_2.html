    <h1>Designing for Web Accessibility</h1>
    <h2>By Gicelle, Dylan and Raghav</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>This webpage provides recommendations for user interface design (UI) and visual design more accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Contrast with Foreground and Background</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>The colour of text in the foreground must contrast the background colour for information to be more easily conveyed. This includes images, buttons, and any other elements.</li>
        <li>The correct terminology for this is “luminance contrast ratio”, or “contrast ratio” for short.</li>
        <li>However, this does not apply to logos or and incidental text such as text in images.</li>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <h4>Insufficient</h4>
        <div class="bad">
        <p>Some people cannot read text if there is not sufficient contrast between the text and background. For others, bright colors (high luminance) are not readable; they need low luminance.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>Sufficient</h4>
        <div class="good">
        <p>Some people cannot read text if there is not sufficient contrast between the text and background. For others, bright colors (high luminance) are not readable; they need low luminance.</p>
        </div>
        </ul>
        <br>
        
      <li><h3>Do NOT use colours alone!</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Colours are useful for contrasting, which can make information more easily conveyed to the user. However, some users may be colour-blind, making colours difficult to interpret.</li>
        <li>Thus, using other identification that is not focused on colour such as symbols and numbers.</li>
      </ul>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <img src="E2.png" class="center">
    
        <li><h3>Simple Interactive UI</h3></li>
        <ul>
          <li>When providing interactive elements (e.g. buttons, links), make sure they are easy to identify.</li>
          <li>This can be achieved by having:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Mouse hover style</li>
            <li>Keyboard focus style</li>
            <li>Touch or click style</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <img src="E3.png" class="center">

      <li><h3>Simple Navigation</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure that navigation (e.g. links to another page/website) has consistent naming, styling and positioning.</li>
        <li>Do NOT only have one way of navigation, and implement different types (i.e. site search or a site map)</li>
        <li>Use orientation cues (e.g. breadcrumbs - like a file directory) to help user experience and help them understand where they are in a website.</li>
      </ul>

      <li><h3>Clear Labels</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure that all fields have a descriptive label adjacent to the field.</li>
        <li>Position labels to the left or above the field (except for checkboxes and radio buttons - typically to the right)</li>
        <li>Avoid having too much space between labels and fields.</li>
      </ul>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <img src="E3.png" class="center">
       
      <li><h3>Identifiable Interaction Feedback</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>This includes confirming form submission, alerting the user when something goes wrong, or notifying the user of changes on the page. This should be easy to identify.</li>
        <li>Important feedback should be easily noticeable and identifiable, using contrast (colours and symbols).</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
        <img src="E5.png" class="center">

      <li><h3>Headings and Spacing</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use whitespace to make the content more clear. Style classes can be used to group content, add whitespace, and make it easier to scan and understand.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Example:</h4>
        <img src="E6.png" class="center">

        <li><h3>Different Viewport Sizes</h3></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure the webpage can adapt to different screen sizes. Consider positioning, text-size, etc.</li>
          <li>Ensure that text size and line width are set to maximize readability and legibility.</li>
          <li>Large screens can use multiple columns, visible navigation options, and visible secondary information. </li>
          <li> Smaller screen can use a single column for content and icons (for navigation options and secondary information).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <li><h3>Images and Media</h3></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Although this is good for visuals and makes the UI more aesthetic, provide alternatives: </li>
          <ol>
            <li>Transcript of audio</li>
            <li>Audio description of videos</li>
            <li>Text with buttons/icons</li>
            <li>Captions and descriptions for tables or complex images</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>
        
        <li><h3>Provide Controls for Immediate Content</li></h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide visible controls to allow users to stop any animations or auto-playing sound.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </ol>
